# **Networking Fundamentals**

## **1. The OSI Model**

A seven-layer framework for understanding how networking systems communicate:

* **Application Layer**: Provides services for user applications.
* **Presentation Layer**: Manages data translation, encryption, and compression.
* **Session Layer**: Establishes and maintains connections.
* **Transport Layer**: Divides data into packets.
* **Network Layer**: Selects the best/shortest routing path.
* **Data Link Layer**: Converts packets into frames.
* **Physical Layer**: Converts into bit streams (binary) and sends via mediums like Wi-Fi or Ethernet.

## **2. TCP/IP Model**

* **Application**
* **Transport**
* **Internet Layer**
* **Network Access Layer**

## **3. Networking Devices**

Devices facilitating network management:

* **Hub**: Broadcasts data to all connected devices (Layer 1).
* **Bridge**: Filters traffic based on MAC addresses (Layer 2).
* **Switch**: Intelligent traffic management with high port count (Layer 2).
* **Router**: Routes data across networks using IP addresses (Layer 3).

* **Bus Topology**: Single cable connecting devices.
* **Star Topology**: Devices connect to a central hub.
* **Ring Topology**: Devices form a circular connection.
* **Mesh Topology**: Each device connects to every other.
* **Hybrid Topology**: Combines multiple topologies.

## **5. Types of Networks**

* **LAN (Local Area Network)**: Covers small areas (e.g., offices).
* **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**: Connects multiple LANs within a city.
* **WAN (Wide Area Network)**: Spans large geographic areas (e.g., the Internet).

---

## **6. IP Addressing**

* **IPv4**: 32-bit address (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).
* **IPv6**: 128-bit address (e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334`).

Key terms:

* **Network ID**: The starting address of an IP range.
* **Broadcast ID**: The ending address of an IP range.
* **Subnet Mask**: Defines internal network boundaries.

## **7. Protocols: TCP vs UDP**

* **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: Reliable data transmission.
* **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**: Fast but less reliable.
